Students need to repload the same documents on various portals again and again for admission to various colleges and universities."passport-ed" acts as a common medium between students and multiple universities so students can provide access to the universities they want to apply with just one click. 



Currently confidential documents like aadhar, bonafide certificates, gradesheets go into third-party providers who store the documents. This increases the chances of personal data becoming vulnerable to privacy intrusion. We aim to provide a platform for students to upload their IDs, bonafides, aadhar and gradesheets on the blockchain via the decentralized IPFS technology.
